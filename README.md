Whenever you search for **server-side rendering** of React applications, you will read it's hard to accomplish. **But why?** Most probably, you'll end up with frameworks like [razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) only because you wanted a little bit of pre-rendered HTML for your React application.

The idea of **cra-serverless** is pretty simple: Use your existing, un-ejected, and unpatched [**create-react-app**][cra] and replace **`BrowserRouter`** with **`StaticRouter`**, deploy it to [**AWS Lambda**][lambda], and finally put a CDN in front of it. You'll have your same React SPA, but now you can have pre-rendered HTML content for all routes in your application. This even works fine with frameworks like [**styled-components**][sc] or [**apollo client**][apollo] for using [**GraphQL on AppSync**][appsync].

Yes, this is **serverless server-side rendering**, so let's call it **serverless pre-rendering for React**. 🤯

##### Extended Guides:

- [React with server-side rendering on AWS Lambda](https://sbstjn.com/serverless-create-react-app-server-side-rendering-ssr-lamda.html) (**English**)
- [React und server-side rendering mit AWS Lambda und CloudFront](https://superluminar.io/2020/02/07/react-spa-und-server-side-rendering-ssr-mit-aws-lambda-cloudfront-und-dem-cdk/) (**German**)

## Architecture

- **TypeScript**, for God's sake
- Basic **un-ejected** [create-react-app][cra] stored `./src`
- **SSR** using `react-dom/server` and [koa][koa] in `./server`
- **Infrastructure as Code** using [AWS Cloud Development Kit][cdk] in `./aws`
- [AWS Lambda][lambda] for server-side (pre-)rendering of **React SPA**
- [Amazon CloudFront][cloudfront] to **cache pre-rendered HTML** and serve assets from S3
- [AWS CodePipeline][pipeline] and [AWS CodeBuild][codebuild] for **Continious Deployments**

## Usage

The primary goal for [cra-serverless](https://github.com/sbstjn/cra-serverless) is to use a default [create-react-app][cra] setup without any changes and avoid to eject it from react-scripts.

```bash
# Start your local environment as always
$ > yarn start

# Build your static SPA as always
$ > yarn build
```

You can develop and build SPA with the usual flow. Afterwards, you can run a local HTTP server with [koa][koa] to test-drive your server-side rendering. The built project is intended to be uploaded to AWS Lambda, but you can deploy the Node.js application to other services as well.

```bash
# Start local server-side rendering service
$ > yarn run:local

# Build Node.js service for server-side rendering
$ > yarn build:server
```

All full-featured pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild using the  [AWS Cloud Development Kit][cdk] is included to [support continious deployments](#deployments-and-configuration). (*Jump to [Deployments and Configuration](#deployments-and-configuration)*)

## How it Works - In a Nutshell

Most React applications use the `react-router-dom` with `BrowserRouter` :

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'

React.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
)
```

Lucky us, a `StaticRouter` exists as well and `react-dom` has a function called `renderToString` :

```typescript
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'
import { StaticRouter } from 'react-router-dom'

const markup = renderToString(
  <StaticRouter location={path}>
    <App />
  </StaticRouter>,
)
```

Next, the value of `markup` will be injected into your `index.html` file and that's it. In a Nutshell, [**cra-serverless**][cra-serverless] uses existing features of the frameworks you already use and wraps them in a serverless architecture with AWS Lambda.

## Deployments and Configuration

Based on [cra-pipeline][cra-pipeline], all you need is a [personal GitHub Access Token][token] and your own fork of this repository. If you have both things in place, store the token in [AWS Systems Manager][sm]:

```bash
$ > aws secretsmanager create-secret \
    --name GitHubToken \
    --secret-string abcdefg1234abcdefg56789abcdefg \
    --region us-east-1

{
  "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789001:secret:GitHubToken-uNBxTr",
  "Name": "GitHubToken",
  "VersionId": "4acda3d1-877f-4032-b38e-17bc50239883"
}
```

As everything is configured using [AWS Cloud Development Kit][cdk], you need to prepare (_aka bootstrap_) your AWS account once for the usage of the **CDK** in your desired AWS region:

```bash
$ > yarn cdk bootstrap --region us-east-1

⏳  Bootstrapping environment aws://123456789001/us-east-1...

0/2 | 5:06:49 PM | CREATE_IN_PROGRESS   | AWS::S3::Bucket | StagingBucket
0/2 | 5:06:50 PM | CREATE_IN_PROGRESS   | AWS::S3::Bucket | StagingBucket Resource creation Initiated
1/2 | 5:07:11 PM | CREATE_COMPLETE      | AWS::S3::Bucket | StagingBucket

✅  Environment aws://123456789001/us-east-1 bootstrapped.
```

Next, have a look at the `./config.ts` file in the root folder and configure at least the `github` section of the file.

```typescript
export const config = {
  name: 'cra-serverless',
  github: {
    owner: 'sbstjn',
    repository: 'cra-serverless',
  },
  env: { region: 'us-east-1' },
}
```

After changing the GitHub repository information, just deploy the CloudFormation stack for the included [AWS CodePipeline][pipeline] and all resources will be created for you.

```bash
$ > yarn cdk deploy cra-serverless-pipeline

Pipeline: deploying...
Pipeline: creating CloudFormation changeset...

✅  Pipeline
```

Head over to the [AWS Management Console][console] and watch the beauty of a deploy pipeline and CloudFormation stacks. All resources will be created for you, and after a while a [CloudFront Distribution][cloudfront] is available for the included example application.
